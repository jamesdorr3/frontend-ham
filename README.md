# HAM

HAM is a simple macronutrient tracker. The aim is to give the user an abundance of data (calories, fat, carbs, and protein) about each food, each meal, and the day in total at a glance, but still look organized and be easy to manipulate. HAM is a Single Page Application, and both the amount and the measure of each food can be edited in real time.

This repo is the frontend. The backend is [here](https://github.com/jamesdorr3/backend-ham)

## Getting Started

During development, the system runs the backend on localhost:3001. I use PostgreSQL 11 and the command ```rails s -p 3001```. This project is not yet on a website.
